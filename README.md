# How to contribute Localization

If you want to localize PayForMe into your language you are very welcome! Here is a short guide how, if you localized another iOS app you should find it familiar.

## MacOS way

If you are using MacOS, there is an awesome helper app called [LocalizationEditor](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor).

To add a new localization, fork the project on github, download it, open it in XCode and then navigate to the Project/Info settings, and add a new localization file there. It is recommended, but not necessary to use LocalizationHelper then to easily translate all strings. Afterwards, commit and push you changes and open a pull request to the main repository.
